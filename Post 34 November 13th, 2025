Question at position 3 
We have a processor (CPU) with clock rate of 1 GHz.   When this processor polls an I/O device, each poling action takes 500 clock cycles.   The CPU is polling the hard drive, which sends data 4 bytes at a time at a rate of 2 MB/s.  What fraction of the CPU’s time is spent polling the hard drive?

Question at position 4 
We have a processor (CPU) with clock rate of 2 GHz.  We also have a hard drive that produces 210 interrupts per second when active, and the drive is active 5% of the time. 

The overhead of interrupting the CPU and performing the transfer is 500 clock cycles. What fraction of the CPU’s time is spent attending to the hard drive?
