Dear God, 
i am collecting senior friends who are staying in dallas post grad 
i will be working in dallas post grad as of now 
this is getting real ngl 
life without school is so very unknown. 
ive been in school for 18 years straight, 
always the same routine of school to summer and repeat again. 
there is no more summer break.
