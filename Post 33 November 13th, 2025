NO CLASS TODAY 
"You can use the extra time to work on your blogs, your legacy project, etc.

Tuesday we will discuss missions and legacy a bit more. Have a safe weekend!

Love,

Willie

p.s. Our final exam will be on Dec 9, our last day of class. In case you weren't in class when that was announced."
